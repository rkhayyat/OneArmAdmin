# One Arm (إيد وحدة):
Mobile application to help Syrian refugees in France.

The application is still in its early stage, for the time being, the only functionality available is reading/writting archived articles stored on Firebase db.
***
#Add features:
The application in the administrator mode can add photo to an article from one of two sources:

1- From Camera, using [nativescript-camera](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-camera) plugin.

2- From images stored in the phone, using [nativescript-imagepicker](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-imagepicker) plugin.

# Screenshots:
The application consists of two section:

- Part I: The administrator's section, where they can log-in with their email and password to edit, create or delete an article.
